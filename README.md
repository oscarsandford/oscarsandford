I'm Oscar, a computer science student studying at the University of Victoria in Canada. As one of my hobbies, I dabble in various areas of my field in order to fortify my foundational understanding and explore topics that interest me.

Recently, my primary concentrations have been in ML/RL, software development (Rust, Python, C++), and full stack development (React, PostgreSQL, JS/TS).
