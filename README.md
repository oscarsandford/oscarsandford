I am Oscar, a writer and programmer from Canada with a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Victoria. 

As one of my hobbies, I dabble in various areas of my field in order to fortify my foundational understanding and explore topics that interest me. My GitHub showcases some of these efforts.

Recently, my primary concentrations have been in ML/RL, software development (Rust, Python, C++), and full stack development (React, SQL, JS/TS).
