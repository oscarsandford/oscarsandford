I'm Oscar, a third year computer science student studying at the University of Victoria in Canada. <br>
My interests, projects and topics of personal research often touch on

* 💻 Web and Software Development
* 📊 Data Science and Statistics
* 🔒 Security Engineering
* 🧩 Computational Theory

For a year I worked with Team Quay, a group of undergraduates from various disciplines to develop Augur The Aspects, a mobile RPG coded in GDScript with the Godot Engine. Development is currently in hiatus.

Download the installer for my racing game [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vpioitartag4zh0/Infinity%20Drift%20Alpha%20Setup.exe?dl=0)! Built with the Unity Engine and inspired by the manga/anime Initial D.
