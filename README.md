I'm Oscar, a computer science student studying at the University of Victoria in Canada. As one of my hobbies, I dabble in various areas of my field in order to fortify my foundational understanding and explore topics that interest me.

## Projects

### Web Development 🖱️
I learned how to design and maintain a functional dynamic web application for my family's business using React, Express, and PostgreSQL in a NodeJS environment. Check out the site [here](https://www.skypilotent.ca/).

### Game Development 🎮
During my first year of programming at UVic, I used Unity to piece together a racing game inspired by the manga Initial D. The installer can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vpioitartag4zh0/Infinity%20Drift%20Alpha%20Setup.exe?dl=0). 

For a year I worked with Team Quay, a group of undergraduates from various disciplines, to develop *Augur The Aspects*, a 2D mobile RPG, using the Godot Engine. For various reasons, development was halted in September 2020. In summer 2021 I returned to Godot solo, building a new 3D action role-playing game inspired by *Dark Souls*. Development enters hiatus in fall 2021.
